## Analysis

### FADU
FADU provides basic tournament management and game scheduling capabilities. However, it lacks automatic scoring systems, inter-sport rankings, and membership validation features. The platform does not support hierarchical administration or PDF game sheet generation.

### Sportlyzer
Sportlyzer focuses on athlete registration and calendar management but does not offer tournament management, result registration, or any scoring/ranking capabilities. It's primarily designed for individual athlete tracking rather than comprehensive competition management.

### Taça UA (Current)
The current Taça UA system relies heavily on manual processes using Excel spreadsheets, Google Forms, and social media for communication. While functional, this approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks real-time updates. Historical data is maintained in Excel, making it difficult to analyze trends or provide public access.

### Taça UA (Project)
The proposed Taça UA platform addresses all identified gaps by providing:
- **Comprehensive Management:** Full tournament, sport, and team management with hierarchical administration
- **Automation:** Automatic scoring, ranking calculation, and member validation
- **Transparency:** Public calendar with filters, real-time results, and historical data access
- **Efficiency:** PDF game sheet generation, integrated communication, and streamlined workflows
- **Scalability:** Multi-season support with complete data preservation

The new platform will consolidate all competition management activities into a single, integrated system, eliminating manual processes and providing real-time information to all stakeholders.
