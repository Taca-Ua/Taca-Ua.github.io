This document presents the use case diagram for the Taça UA platform, illustrating the interactions between different user types and the system.

The platform supports three main user types:

- **Administrador Geral (General Administrator)**: Manages system-wide operations including sports, courses, tournaments, competitions, seasons, regulations, game schedules, and results
- **Administrador Secundário (Core Administrator)**: Manages course-specific operations including player rosters, team lineups, equipment numbers, and game sheet generation
- **Público (Public User)**: Can view public information including calendars, results, rankings, and regulations without authentication

The system also includes authentication capabilities shared between administrators. The complete use case diagram showing all interactions and relationships is available below.
